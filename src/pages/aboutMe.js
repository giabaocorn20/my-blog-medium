        <h2>Who am I</h2>
        <p>Greetings, visitor! I'm Bao, also known as Jason, currently pursuing my studies in electrical engineering at
          Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU). Nature, particularly Physics and Maths, has always captivated my
          interest. Back in secondary school, I delved into the world of Mathematics, and it became a passion.</p>
        <p>As a curious kid, topics like chip design and software engineering always fascinated me. When the time came
          to choose a major for university, it was a no-brainer – engineering it was!</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy expanding my skill set. Whether it's diving into new programming languages or
          exploring the latest technology trends, I love learning. Occasionally, I embark on DIY projects found online,
          turning free time into a fun and creative outlet. When I'm not occupied with studies or projects, you'll find
          me working out, sipping on coffee or Coke, indulging in croissants, and taking nighttime strolls around the
          city. Neon Genesis Evangelion holds the title of my all-time favorite anime.</p>
        <p>I am a perfectionist. I want to solve the problems in my hands in perfect ways, which is, however, not
          achievable in many situations. I also apply Bellman Equation in the optimization of my life, which is a Markov
          decision process, but the future discount factor in the equation might be small and I would often be trapped
          in local optimum.</p>
